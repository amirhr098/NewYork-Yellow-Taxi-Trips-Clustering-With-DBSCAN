# NewYork-Yellow-Taxi-Trips-Clustering-With-DBSCAN

In this project I try to cluster the NY taxi data sets by SciKit Learn DBSCAN and finding the best value of 'eps' and 'min_samples' by Silhouette Score

Original Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration (Only used 'train.csv'.)

Feel free to send better clustering value for me:)
